# Unprivate :bookmark_tabs:

This is the repository for Unprivate, an small project I had in my mind for a couple months.
Essentially, it is like a shared notepad. Everyone can write on it, but theres different *keys*:key:. These *keys*:key: let you have different notepads, and anyone with the specific key can access that notepad:closed_lock_with_key:. 

> 1 key equals to 1 notepad

In terms on how useful this is, I imagined the following:

- You are someone that uses public computers, or different computers, and want a way to share information between them.
- You want to save bookmarks or notes or things that are not too important.
- You want to share stuff anonymously.

### Potential Features
- Markdown compatible text editor
- Configuration settings for each key/notepad
- Automatic saving for changes in notepad
